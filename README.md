## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a crash game where players bet on how long a plane will fly
before it crashes. The plane starts flying at a slow speed, and its
speed gradually increases over time. Players can cash out their bets at
any time before the plane crashes, and they will win a payout based on
the multiplier that the plane has reached when they cash out.

## How to Play Aviator

Playing Aviator is simple. First, you need to choose a bet amount. You
can bet as little as 10 BDT or as much as 1,000 BDT.

Once you have chosen your bet amount, you need to click on the
"Bet" button. The plane will then start flying, and you will need
to decide when to cash out your bet.

You can cash out your bet at any time by clicking on the "Cash
Out" button. You will win a payout based on the multiplier that the
plane has reached when you cash out.

## How to Win at Aviator

There is no surefire way to win at Aviator, but there are a few things
you can do to increase your chances of winning.

-   **Start with a small bet amount.** This will help you to minimize
    your losses if the plane crashes quickly.
-   **Cash out early.** Don\'t wait too long to cash out your bet. The
    longer you wait, the more likely it is that the plane will crash.
-   **Use the auto cashout feature.** This feature allows you to set a
    multiplier value, and the game will automatically cash out your bet
    when the plane reaches that multiplier.
